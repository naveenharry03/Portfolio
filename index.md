### Final Thesis - AI Stock Market Prediction Bot - InProgress 

<p style="text-align: justify;">In today's interconnected world, stock market trading profoundly impacts individuals from all walks of life. Unfortunately, a significant number of people lack the essential knowledge to trade effectively, leading them to rely on costly financial experts. This often results in frustration and financial losses. In response to this challenge, a groundbreaking AI-powered solution is proposed to provide personalized recommendations specifically tailored to the Nifty50 index that match individual needs and risk preferences. This research focuses on improving Nifty50 index prediction models. Existing models predict daily closing prices without considering investors' backgrounds. The gap lies in the absence of tailored advice for individual investors. To fill this gap, an AI bot will gather information about investors' finances, abilities, and interests. Using advanced techniques like BERT and LSTM, the AI bot will analyze news sentiment and use technical indicators to predict Nifty50 index movements. Drawing from historical data spanning the Nifty50 index's trajectory, the model is poised to yield accurate predictions for the imminent days, furnishing projected values encompassing Open, High, Low, and Close prices for the next trading session. Nifty50 Historic Datasets from 2010 to 2023 and Nifty50 news Headlines Datasets from 2014 to 2023 shall form the bedrock of this research endeavor. The AI bot will categorize investments into low, medium, or high-risk preferences to give personalized recommendations. The project's outcome is an AI bot that provides investors with tailored buy-sell advice based on their risk profile and financial capability. By combining AI, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators, this solution empowers individuals to make informed investment decisions, reducing risks and increasing investment confidence. This research has the potential to democratize stock trading, enabling everyone to trade smarter and independently.</p>
